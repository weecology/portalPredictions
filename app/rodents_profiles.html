One of two competitors for title of 'smallest Portal rodent,' <i>B. taylori</i> is currently an infrequent but welcome visitor to the site. As it is primarily a grassland species, individuals caught on the site rarely stay for long. Interestingly, the roughly 8-gram <i>B. taylori</i> is often found in association with cotton rats (<i>Sigmodon</i>), which can weight in excess of 100 grams. </td>

It is essentially a giant version of its congeneric relative, the desert pocket mouse (<i>C. penicillatus</i>). While close in size to Merriam's and Ord's kangaroo rats, it is an inferior competitor and, therefore, is found almost solely on kangaroo rat exclosure plots. </td>

Now, this small pocket mouse is one of the main seasonal drivers of total rodent abundance at the site. The population explodes in the summers with known individuals, new adults, and brand new babies alike; they are ubiquitous across the site, regardless of plot type. In the winters, <i>C. penicillatus</i> enters a type of torpor (not quite hibernation), creating a large seasonal fluctuation in abundance.   </td>

It has by far the largest feet on the site at a whopping 48 mm average and often weighs in at over 100 grams, nearly twice the size of the other kangaroo rats. Spectabs were once running the show at Portal. As the site became shrubbier, however, the reign of <i>D. spectabilis</i> came to a slow end in the 1990's.

Woodrats are quite different ecologically from the rest of the species at the site. Unlike the majority of our rodents which are granivorous, <i>N. albigula</i> is primarily a foliovore. (The resident woodrat in our ramada, however, seems to eat just about anything.) Woodrats---also commonly known as packrats---build middens, or large nests, out of sticks and any 'interesting' debris they can get their paws on. While their numbers at the site aren't prolific, research assistants know exactly which kangaroo rat exclosure plots this species tends to inhabit and secretly wish they'd brought leather gloves with them. </td>

In addition to eating insects and scorpions, they have been known to eat venomous centipedes and even other mice. Both species also have a distinctive high-pitched 'howl' when defending their territory. Mighty though they are, both species, and <i>O. leucogaster</i> in particular, have hilariously short tails.
