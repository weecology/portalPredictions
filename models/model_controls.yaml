    text: AutoArima (Automatic Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a flexible
      Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model fit to the data at the
      composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite
      (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The model is selected
      and  fitted using the `auto.arima` and `forecast` functions in the **forecast**
      package [@Hyndman2013; @Hyndman2017] within the `AutoArima()` function. Generally,
      ARIMA models are defined according to three model structure parameters -- the
      number of autoregressive terms (p), the degree of differencing (d), and the
      order of the moving average (q), and are represented as ARIMA(p, d, q) [@Box1970].
      While the `auto.arima` function allows for seasonal models, the seasonality
      is hard-coded to be on the same period as the sampling, which is not the case
      for the Portal rodent surveys. As a result, no seasonal models were evaluated.
      AutoArima is fit flexibly, such that the model parameters can vary from fit
      to fit.

      (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community)
      and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The model is selected and fitted
      using the `ets` and `forecast` functions in the **forecast** package [@Hyndman2017]
      with the `allow.multiplicative.trend` argument set to `TRUE` within the `ESSS()`
      function. Models fit using `ets` implement what is known as the "innovations"
      approach to state space modeling, which assumes a single source of noise that
      is equivalent for the process and observation errors [@Hyndman2008]. In general,
      ESSS models are defined according to three model structure parameters -- error
      type, trend type, and seasonality type [@Hyndman2008]. Each of the parameters
      can be an N (none), A (additive), or M (multiplicative) state [@Hyndman2008].
      However, because of the difference in period between seasonality and sampling
      of the Portal rodents combined with the hard-coded single period of the `ets`
      function, we could not include the seasonal components to the ESSS model. ESSS
      is fit flexibly, such that the model parameters can vary from fit to fit.

      fit to the interpolated data at the composite (full site and just control plots)
      spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species)
      ecological levels. The response variable is Poisson, and a variety of environmental

      The pevGARCH model is fit using the log link and a Poisson response, as well

      The environmental variables potentially included in the model are min, mean,
      and max temperatures, precipitation, and NDVI.  The `tsglm` function in the
      **tscount** package [@Liboschik2017a] uses a (conditional) quasi-likelihood

      sets of the environmental covariates --  [1] max temp, mean temp, precipitation,
      NDVI; [2] max temp, min temp, precipitation, NDVI; [3] max temp, mean temp,
