#The Portal Project

[The Portal project](http://portal.weecology.org/), located in the Chihuahuan desert of southern Arizona, is a long-term experimental monitoring project in desert ecology. There are over 40 years of data on rodents, plants, ants, and weather at the site. Rodent data are collected approximately monthly, an ideal scenario for short-term forecasts of rodent abundance.

#Ecological Forecasting

There is a need for short term iterative forecasts in ecology. We are using our monthly rodent trapping to create a platform for automated and validated forecasting.
