* Video "Portal forecasts" before the trip, potentially coupled with "live reports from the field"
* Watching these [live updating Brexit forecasts], where they basically update after each region reports in,
  makes me think it could be fun sometime to do this plot by plot as the data is collected. We obviously
  wouldn't want to do this every trip, but as a one-off or a once a year special activity it could be fun.
